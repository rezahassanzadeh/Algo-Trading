The code implements a pairs trading strategy based on a paper by Gatev et al. (2006) on a portfolio of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, temporal cross-section analysis, category performance, and transaction costs effect are also examined. The aim is to explore the profitability of this simple method in a new market. 

Results suggest poor profitability if daily data are used with distance method for pair formation. This shows the overal market efficiency has increased, and to obtain similar performance to 2000's, we need to use statistical arbitrage methods on higher-frequency data, with more sophisticated pair formation strategies.
